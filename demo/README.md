# SB-example

This repo is an example (and test) for `SB`.

## How to...

- Install dependencies `npm i`
- Run dev version `npm run dev`
    - open http://localhost:3000
- Export to static site `npm run export`
    - Optionally install http-serve `npm i -g http-serve` and then `http-serve ./out`

This is a work in progress and everything can change. 

> SB is still in beta
